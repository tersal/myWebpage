                    <p class="text-center">Hannibal was the son of Hamilcar Barca, a Carthaginian leader who started the consolidation of the Carthage interests in the Iberian peninsula. Since Hannibal was a child, he sworn to never be a friend of Rome and according to some accounts "[...] use fire and steel to arrest the destiny of Rome", he managed to complete the conquest of Hispania after the death of Hasdrubal (his brother-in-law).</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Rome made an alliance with the city of Saguntum to stop the Hannibal advances in the Iberic peninsula, however Hannibal started a siege and fell after eight months. Rome demanded justice from Carthage, but Carthage in turn declared war to Rome, the war that Hannibal sought for so long.</p>

                                <p>This was the first battle of the second Punic War in December 218 BC. This was an important Roman defeat with around 32,000 casualties. In this battle Hannibal provoked a frontal assault of the consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus under physically difficult circumstances leading him to a trap.</p>
                                <p>The battle took place in  flat country of the Province of Piacenza on the left bank of the Trebbia River where Hannibal troops awaited for the Roman troops to cross the river and engage directly while Mago, Hannibal's brother, prepared an ambush concealed in the underbrush of the river under the cover of the night</p>

                                <p>This was an important battle where the Carthaginians dfetated the consul Gaius Flaminius. This battle is considered, by number of men involved, as the largest ambush in history.</p>
                                <p>The Romans appointed Fabius Maximus as their dictator. Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the strategy named after him, avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements.</p>
                                <p>Hannibal tried to lure Gaius into battle marching through several Roman cities without any luck since Fabius refused to start a direct battle with Hannibal. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice.</p>
                                <p>The forces in the battle were around 55,000 soldiers for Hannibal and 30,000 for Gaius, the aftermath of the battle was a defeat for the Romans with around 15,000 casualties (2,500 for Carthago).

                                <p>In the spring of 216 bc, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. By capturing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial sources of supply. The Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50-80,000.</p>
                                <p>Hannibal used an envelopment tactic eliminating the numerical advantage of the Romans. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horses. The Romans pushed against the weaker center but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible. Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape.</p>
                                <p>The forces in the battle were around 50,000 soldiers for Hannibal and 86,000 for the Romans, and with the previous tactics Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000-70,000 Romans were killed or captured.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Even with all the previous victories and battle skills of Hannibal, he was forced to retreat to face Scipio Africanus who was marching towards Carthage where the Romans now had the advantage in cavalry when Carthage had the advantage in infantry.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center">The Roman cavalry won an early victory by swiftly routing the Carthaginian horse, and standard Roman tactics for limiting the effectiveness of the Carthaginian war elephants were successful, including playing trumpets to frighten the elephants into running into the Carthaginian lines. Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal. Scipio was able to rally his men and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, to attack Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">With their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to surrender. Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded. In contrast, the Romans suffered only 2,500 casualties. The last major battle of the Second Punic War resulted in a loss of respect for Hannibal by his fellow Carthaginians. The conditions of defeat were such that Carthage could no longer battle for Mediterranean supremacy.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary text-center">In the end</h2>
                <p class="text-center">Hannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of antiquity, together with Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Scipio, and Pyrrhus of Epirus. Plutarch states that Hannibal was questioned by Scipio as to who was the greatest general, and Hannibal replied either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself. Military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge called Hannibal the "father of strategy", because his greatest enemy, Rome, came to adopt elements of his military tactics in its own strategic arsenal. This praise has earned him a strong reputation in the modern world, and he was regarded as a great strategist by Napoleon Bonaparte and others.</p>
